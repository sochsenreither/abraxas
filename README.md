> **Note to readers:** The Ditto protocol implemented in this repo is currently under developement and will soon be published. In the meantime, you may be interested in the [2-chain HotStuff](https://github.com/asonnino/hotstuff) and [3-chain HotStuff](https://github.com/asonnino/hotstuff/tree/3-chain) that implements the classic HotStuff protocol.

This repo provides a minimal implementation of the Ditto protocol, which is 2-chain HotStuff with asynchronous fallback. The codebase has been designed to be small, efficient, and easy to benchmark and modify. It has not been designed to run in production but uses real cryptography ([dalek](https://doc.dalek.rs/ed25519_dalek)), networking ([tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio)), and storage ([rocksdb](https://docs.rs/rocksdb)). More details about the protocol can be found in our paper [Jolteon and Ditto: Network-Adaptive Efficient Consensus with Asynchronous Fallback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10362).

## Quick Start
Ditto is written in Rust, but all benchmarking scripts are written in Python and run with [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/).
To deploy and benchmark a testbed of 4 nodes on your local machine, clone the repo and install the python dependencies:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/danielxiangzl/hotstuff.git
$ cd hotstuff/benchmark
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You also need to install Clang (required by rocksdb) and [tmux](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/#installing-tmux) (which runs all nodes and clients in the background). Finally, run a local benchmark using fabric:
```
$ fab local
```
This command may take a long time the first time you run it (compiling rust code in `release` mode may be slow) and you can customize a number of benchmark parameters in `fabfile.py`. When the benchmark terminates, it displays a summary of the execution similarly to the one below.
```

## Next Steps
The [wiki](https://github.com/asonnino/hotstuff/wiki) documents the codebase, explains its architecture and how to read benchmarks' results, and provides a step-by-step tutorial to run [benchmarks on Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/asonnino/hotstuff/wiki/AWS-Benchmarks) accross multiple data centers (WAN).
